Description: A novel method for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR)
             in structural sparsity setting. This proposed scheme relaxes the linear subspace
             constraint to its neighborhood, often known as variable splitting in optimization.
             Simulation experiments can be reproduced following the Vignette.
             'Split Knockoffs' is defined in Cao et al. (2021) <arXiv:2103.16159>.
